### Deployment

Some of the testing required for the application requires that the application be deployed. For one, the application needed to be served via HTTPS to enable the PWA capabilities and for it to be served via HTTPS, it had to have an ssl certificate installed on a production server. Free tier resources from Amazon Web Services (AWS) were used while a domain from Google Domains was purchased.
