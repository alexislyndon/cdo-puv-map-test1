# Displaying a Map on a Webpage

Creation of a map for viewing on a webpage requires only a single HTML file with references to a CSS file and a Javascript file linked via <link> and <script> tags in the <head> section of the HTML document. Another <script> tag inside the body of a document is used to draw a tilelayer over the `L.map` object to display tiles requested from a tile provider.
