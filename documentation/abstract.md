Cagayan de Oro City, like most cities in the Philippines, suffer from poor information dissemination of Public Utility Vehicle (PUV) data. The data, although available from the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB), is neither available in physical print nor thru digital means. A web application is created to satisfy the needs of the commuting public for a PUV or a Commuting route map. By asking the commuting public of their expectations of the application and by inspecting already available web mapping implementations. The study determined that, not only do commuters expect the graphical route information of a certain line, they also expect the application to have a Journey Planning or Directions feature. Along with interactivity features that would be the norm for the current web applications, an Web-Based Interactive PUV Route Map for Cagayan de Oro City is produced. The creation of an online PUV Route Map would likely boost the public transportation sector and improve commuter confidence to ride public transportation.
